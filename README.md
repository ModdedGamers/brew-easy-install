# brew-easy-install

This is a script to easily install https://brew.sh to your home directory in `~/.brew`.

Disclaimers: This installs to a non-standard prefix, so don't be surprised if you end up compiling a lot of stuff from source.

Make an issue if you encounter any problems!


# Common Installation Steps
Right-click and click "Save as..." on [this link.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModdedGamers/brew-easy-install/main/brew-easy-install.sh)
Next, press Command and the spacebar at the same time, type in "Terminal"(without quotes), and press Enter.
Next, type this in and press enter:

`sh Downloads/brew-easy-install.sh`

Once that gives you your prompt back, open a new terminal tab by pressing Command and "T" at the same time.
then, type `brew` and press enter to test. Once that's done, proceed to the appropriate section


## APCSP Students
Type the following in the Terminal: `brew install node`. This will take a longer time then the first command, and a lot more will happen
That's OK.
Once that finishes, type `node` and press enter. If you get a prompt that looks like `>`, then you are good. Press Control and "D" at the same
time to exit. You're done!
